# CipherSQLStudio

CipherSQLStudio is a full-stack SQL learning and execution platform that allows users to write SQL queries, execute them against a real PostgreSQL database, and receive intelligent hints powered by an LLM — without revealing the final solution.

This project was developed as part of a **Full-Stack Developer Recruitment Assignment (Project-Based Evaluation)**.
